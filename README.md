# ch19reversingStringsWithSTLstacks

Create a project that uses an STL stack container to hold a vector of strings. The code will push the individual words of a phrase onto the stack, measure the size of the stack, then pop the words off. Since you are using a stack, the last word pushed onto the stack will be the first word popped off the stack. The result will reverse the initial phrase. The phrase is "this question to us demands wisdom". The result looks like this:

![ch19-reverseString.PNG](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch19reversingStringsWithSTLstacks/blob/main/ch19reversingStringsSTLstacks/wisdom.PNG)

Hard code the push for each word in the phrase. Use a while loop to pop the elements on the stack. There is no user input.

Take a screenshot of the results.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
